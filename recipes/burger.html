        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Connect with your plant side and cook up the BEST <strong>Vegan Burger</strong> recipe you’ll ever try! Made with black beans, protein-rich ingredients, and warm spices, they’re every bit as satisfying as they are scrumptious.</p>

<p>Lightly crisp outside, tender (not mushy!) inside, and boasting an intense savoriness that you wouldn’t expect in a vegetarian burger recipe, these are hands-down not only the best vegan burgers—they are one of the best burgers, period—I have ever tasted.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>FOR THE BURGERS:</h4>

            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons cumin</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 can black beans, (15 ounces) rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>½ cup old fashioned rolled oats gluten free if needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>TOPPINGS IDEAS:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Sliced tomatoes, avocado, arugula, sliced red onions, avocado, plain yogurt (dairy-free if needed), mustard
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat mat.</li>
            <li>Place the red pepper and onion in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Pulse until minced. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>To the food processor, add the almonds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, flaxseed meal, garlic, salt, cumin, chili powder, and smoked paprika.</li>
            <li>Blend until it has combined into a coarse grainy mixture. Scrape into the mixing bowl with the onion and red pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the black beans, oats, and 2 tablespoons water in the food processor.</li>
            <li>Puree until the beans are mostly smooth with a few small pieces remaining.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the mixing bowl and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Scoop the burger mixture in 1/3 cup portions into your hands. Shape into palm-sized patties that are about 1 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Arrange on the baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, then flip and bake 5-10 additional minutes, until heated through and the outsides are lightly crisp. Serve on buns with any desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
